# Capture the Flag (CTF) Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my hands-on experience and solutions to various Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. It includes experiments and challenges covering multiple domains of cybersecurity. The final CTF challenge demonstrates my ability to solve comprehensive, multi-domain tasks.

## Categories
The repository is organized into the following categories:

### 1. Cryptography (Crypto)
- Challenges focused on encryption, decryption, and cryptographic attacks.
- Explored techniques such as RSA vulnerabilities, hashing algorithms, and symmetric key cryptography.

### 2. Web Exploitation (Web)
- Analyzed web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and insecure authentication.
- Implemented solutions to exploit and secure web applications.

### 3. Digital Forensics (Forensics)
- Investigated forensic artifacts like memory dumps, network captures, and file metadata.
- Applied forensic tools and techniques to uncover hidden information.

### 4. Reverse Engineering (Reversing)
- Focused on decompiling binaries, understanding code structures, and extracting critical information.
- Utilized tools such as Ghidra and IDA Pro for analysis.

### 5. Binary Exploitation (PWN)
- Exploited vulnerabilities in binaries, including buffer overflows, format string attacks, and Return Oriented Programming (ROP).
- Gained hands-on experience with debugging tools like GDB and pwntools.

### 6. Final CTF Challenge
- Solved a comprehensive set of CTF challenges across all domains.
- Demonstrated a holistic understanding of cybersecurity techniques and tools.

## Key Learnings
- Developed problem-solving skills and practical knowledge in diverse cybersecurity areas.
- Improved proficiency with tools such as Wireshark, Burp Suite, Ghidra, and more.
- Enhanced understanding of real-world vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.

## Repository Structure
Each category includes:
- Problem descriptions.
- Step-by-step solution methodologies.
- Scripts, tools, and configurations used.
- Screenshots and logs showcasing the results.
